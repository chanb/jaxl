# JAXL (JAX Learning)
## Prerequisite:
- Python 3.9
- MuJoCo (See [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco))
  - Remember to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (e..g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_MUJOCO>/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin`)
  - For troubleshooting, see [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#ubuntu-installtion-troubleshooting)

## Installation:
You may simply `pip install`:
```
pip install -r requirements/all.txt
pip install -e .
```

When install Jax on GPU, note that we need to do the following instead (see [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)):
```
# CUDA 12 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

# CUDA 11 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia
```

If `torch` somehow conflicts, install the CPU-only version:
```
pip install torch>=1.13.0+cpu
```

Potential memory issue:
```
export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_graph_level=0
```

### Conda on Salient
```
conda create --name jaxl python=3.9
conda install -c conda-forge glew
conda install -c conda-forge mesalib
conda install jaxlib=*=*cuda* jax cuda-nvcc -c conda-forge -c nvidia
conda install -c menpo glfw3
pip install patchelf
conda install pytorch-cpu torchvision-cpu -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements/conda.txt
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install "cython<3"
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pip install -e .
```

### Compute Canada
You may install this code on Compute Canada by simply running `jaxl/installation/compute_canada/initial_setup.sh`.

## Experiments
### Locally
To run a single experiment, you may execute:
```
python jaxl/main.py --config_path=${config_path} --run_seed=${run_seed} --device=${device}
```
Examples of configuration file (i.e. `config_path`) are located under `jaxl/configs`.
`device` can be `cpu` or `gpu:<device_ids>` (e.g. `gpu:0,1`).

To run multiple experiments, you may refer to `scripts/mtil/local/inverted_pendulum`.
In particular, we first run `generate_experts.py` to construct a bash script, say `run_all-inverted_pendulum.sh`.
Then, running said bash script will execute mutliple experiments.

### Compute Canada
To run on Compute Canada, you may refer to `scripts/mtil/compute_canada`.
In partciular, first run `generate_expert_variants.py` to construct `dat` file, consisting of different hyperparameters.
Then, run `sbatch generate_experts.sh` to run each variant in paralllel.

## Design Pattern
This codebase aims to combine both imitation learning and reinforcement learning into a single design pattern.
To this end, we note that imitation learning consists of supervised learning, which is purely offline, whereas other approaches are more online.
In particular, offline means that we are given a fixed batch of data, whereas online means that we receive a stream of data as the learner interacts with the environment.
We emphasize that learner-environment interactions do not necessarily mean that the learner has influence over the distribution (e.g. online supervised learning).

Consequently, we have few main components:
- `main.py` is the main entrypoint to running experiments, where it defines the save paths, models, buffers, learners, and other necessary components for running an experiment.
- `learning_utils.py` orchestrates the learning progress.
That is, it will instruct the learner to perform updates, keep track of learning progress, and checkpointing the models.
It also provides utilities for constructing models, learners, and optimizers.
- `buffers` consists of various types of buffers.
We currently support the standard replay buffer (`TransitionNumPyBuffer`) and trajectory-based replay buffer (`TrajectoryNumPyBuffer`).
If we wish to add functionality such as prioritized experience replay and hindsight experience replay, we should consider using wrappers/decorators to extend the functionalities.
- `learners` consists of various types of learners.
In particular, there are two types of learners: `OfflineLearner` and `OnlineLearner`, that are realizations of the abstract `Learner` class.
By default, the `Learner` class enforces all learners have a way to perform checkpointing, initializing the parameters, and performing learning updates (if any).
  - `OfflineLearner` assumes that a batch of **offline** data is given, as a `ReplayBuffer`.
  The attribute is `_buffer`, which corresponds the "dataset" in the standard offline learning vocabulary.
  - On the other hand, `OnlineLearner` assumes that it has access to a **buffer**, which is populated sample by sample.
  By varying the buffer size, we can obtain "streaming" online learners that assume to have no *memory*.
  The online learner can also interact with the environment, which is implemented via the `gymnasium` API.

### Supported Custom Environments
We provide customized MuJoCo environments (in both Gymnasium and Deepmind Control Suite) that randomize the physical parameters at the initialization of the environment. This allows us to do some form of multi-task learning, or some form of domain randomization. We achieve this by modifying the XML before passing it to the MuJoCo environment wrapper provided by `MujocoEnv` or `control.Environment`. For more details, the environments are located under `envs/mujoco` and `envs/dmc`.

## Styling
- We use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/README.md) to format code and [`pyment`](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment/blob/master/README.rst) to generate docstrings with `reST` style.

### Generating Docstrings
To generate the docstrings in HTML format, we use [`sphinx`](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx).
```
cd docs
sphinx-apidoc -f -o . ..
make htmlâ€‹
```

## Long-term Modification
- JAX implementation of the replay buffers
- Revisit A2C, PPO, and MTBC for better loss construction.
It seems to be using a different design pattern.
- Revisit how we construct models and optimizers.
There should be a more elegant way.
