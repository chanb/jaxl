# JAXL (JAX Learning)
## Prerequisite:
- Python 3.9
- MuJoCo (See [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco))
  - Remember to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (e..g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_MUJOCO>/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin`)
  - For troubleshooting, see [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#ubuntu-installtion-troubleshooting)

## Installation:
You may simply `pip install`:
```
pip install -e .
```

When install Jax on GPU, note that we need to do the following instead (see [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)):
```
# CUDA 12 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

# CUDA 11 installation
# Note: wheels only available on linux.
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
We also need to change PyTorch to purely CPU:
```
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

## Design Pattern
This codebase aims to combine both imitation learning and reinforcement learning into a single design pattern.
To this end, we note that imitation learning consists of supervised learning, which is purely offline, whereas other approaches are more online.
In particular, offline means that we are given a fixed batch of data, whereas online means that we receive a stream of data as the learner interacts with the environment.
We emphasize that learner-environment interactions do not necessarily mean that the learner has influence over the distribution (e.g. online supervised learning).

Consequently, we have few main components:
- `main.py` is the main entrypoint to running experiments, where it defines the save paths, models, buffers, learners, and other necessary components for running an experiment.
- `learning_utils.py` orchestrates the learning progress.
That is, it will instruct the learner to perform updates, keep track of learning progress, and checkpointing the models.
It also provides utilities for constructing models, learners, and optimizers.
- `buffers` consists of various types of buffers.
We currently support the standard replay buffer (`TransitionNumPyBuffer`) and trajectory-based replay buffer (`TrajectoryNumPyBuffer`).
If we wish to add functionality such as prioritized experience replay and hindsight experience replay, we should consider using wrappers/decorators to extend the functionalities.
- `learners` consists of various types of learners.
In particular, there are two types of learners: `OfflineLearner` and `OnlineLearner`, that are realizations of the abstract `Learner` class.
By default, the `Learner` class enforces all learners have a way to perform checkpointing, initializing the parameters, and performing learning updates (if any).
  - `OfflineLearner` assumes that a batch of **offline** data is given, as a `ReplayBuffer`.
  The corresponding attribute is `_dataset`, following the standard offline learning vocabulary.
  - On the other hand, `OnlineLearner` assumes that it has access to a **buffer**, which is populated sample by sample.
  By varying the buffer size, we can obtain "streaming" online learners that assume to have no *memory*.
  The online learner can also interact with the environment, which is implemented via the `gymnasium` API.


## Styling
- We use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/README.md) to format code and [`pyment`](https://github.com/dadadel/pyment/blob/master/README.rst) to generate docstrings with `reST` style.

### Generating Docstrings
To generate the docstrings in HTML format, we use [`sphinx`](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx).
```
cd docs
sphinx-apidoc -f -o . ..
make htmlâ€‹
```

## TODO:
- Update README as more implementation comes
- Implement code to load and generate expert demonstrations
- Implement behavioural cloning
